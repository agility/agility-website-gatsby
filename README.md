# Getting up and running

## Pre-requisite: Install the Gatsby CLI

```
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

[Additional information for getting started with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)

## Pre-requisite: Get a free Agility CMS account

[Sign up for a free account using the Blog Template](https://account.agilitycms.com/sign-up?product=agility-free).

On *step 2*, give your project a name and ensure you select `Blog Template` as your template.

## Retreive your Agility CMS API Credentials

After going through the sign up process and you are logged in to Agility CMS, on the `Getting Started Page` click the **API Keys** button to retrieve youre credentials.

![Content Fetch API Details](/docs/images/showapikeys.png "Content Fetch API Details")

Then, click the **Show API Key(s)** button to view your `Live` and `Preview` keys.

![Content Fetch API Details](/docs/images/creds.png "Content Fetch API Creds")

 Take note of your `GUID` and your `Live API Key` and `Preview API Key`. Click the **Show** buttons beside both to unmask the credentials and copy these somewhere temporarily, or refer back to this screen when you begin to [Configure your local environment](#configure-local).


## Clone this repo to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/agility/agility-gatsby-starter
```

## Install Node dependencies

With [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

```
cd agility-gatsby-starter
npm install
```

<a name="configure-local"></a>

## Configure your local environment

Rename `./.env.development.example` to `./.env.development`

```
cp .env.development.example .env.development
```

Add your development `AGILITY_GUID` and `AGILITY_API_KEY` variable values in `.env.development`

```
# Your Instance Id
AGILITY_GUID=

# Your Preview API Key (recommended) - you can get this from the Getting Started Page in Agility CMS. It starts with defaultpreview.
AGILITY_API_KEY=

# If using your Preview API Key, set this to true
AGILITY_API_ISPREVIEW=true

```

Rename `./.env.production.example` to `./.env.production`

```
cp .env.production.example .env.production
```

Add your production `AGILITY_GUID` and `AGILITY_API_KEY` variable values in `.env.production`

```
# Your Instance Id
AGILITY_GUID=

# Your Live API Key (recommended) - you can get this from the Getting Started Page in Agility CMS. It starts with defaultlive.
AGILITY_API_KEY=

# Since you won't want to preview here, set this to false
AGILITY_API_ISPREVIEW=false
```

## Start the Gatsby development server

Once the above steps are done, you can launch your local development server:

With [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

```

```

<a name="build"></a>

# How to build a production version of your project and test it

It's good practice to build a production version and test it locally before publishing it or doing a pull request into `master`. Here's how to do it:


With [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```

<a name="deploy"></a>

# Deploy

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/agility/agility-gatsby-starter)

☝️ Deploy this starter repo in just minutes with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You'll need to add your Agility CMS `AGILITY_GUID`, `AGILITY_API_KEY`, and `AGILITY_API_ISPREVIEW` variables in Netlify's **Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment** section.


## gatsby-config.js

You'll want to take a peek under the hood at some point and take the starter's configuration for Gatsby further. To get a better understanding of the `options`, please visit [GatsbyJS Source Plugin for Agility CMS](https://github.com/agility/gatsby-source-agilitycms) on GitHub for documentation.

# What is Agility CMS? What makes it different?

[Agility CMS](https://agilitycms.com/) is a headless Content Management System (CMS) that lets you define your custom content types, relationships and pages. This is called Content Architecture, and you can reuse this content for your websites and apps.

Agility believes that a successful website balances the **User Experience (UX)**, **Editor Experience (EX)**, and **Developer Experience (DX)**. 

While Gatsby tends to handle **UX** and **DX** quite well, too often editors are an after-thought in Gatsby (and other JAMstack) websites. They feel constrained by not being able to manage their sitemap and what content is on which pages.

Agility aims to empower and improve the **Editor Experience** by providing built-in **Page Management**. This means developers can build UI Components and leave editors to compose their pages.
